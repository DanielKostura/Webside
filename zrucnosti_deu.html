        Welcome to my website! My name is Daniel Kostura, I am 19 years old, and I am a student at the Ján Adam Rayman Gymnasium in Prešov. I'm very glad that you've come here and that you want to learn more about me. This website was created as my project for informatics.
        <br>
        <br>
        So far, my life mainly revolves around school, but I try to find time for my interests and hobbies. I enjoy going on hikes with friends, listening to music, as well as exercising and programming. Besides that, I'm also interested in mathematics, which I would like to study in the future, along with computer science.
        <br>
        <br>
        The goal of my website is to provide you with a closer look at my life, my interests, and activities, so welcome once again, and I hope you'll enjoy your time here.
        <br>
